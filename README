LUMIN ORDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reorder a video file by frame luminosity.

Luminosity is processed frame by frame by taking the mean pixel
intensity from [0..1]. Luminosity is then rounded to N decimal places
to reduce fragmentation, so that in-order sequences from the original
material are represented intact. Alter the rounding factor with the
-r argument to achieve different levels of fragmentation.
